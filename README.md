# Saikuda
## Naming
Saikuda is a shortened form of the Japanese phrase Saiakuda Na (最悪だ な), which accurately describes most people who bother to translate this phrase.
## Installation
Saikuda is currently in development, so you'll need to install it manually.
Saikuda at the moment only supports UNIX-like systems (Linux, MacOS, BSD). This is because of technical limitations with terminal support.

To install Saikuda, run the following commands:
```sh
git clone http://www.github.com/tauapp/saikuda.git
cd saikuda
```

To run Saikuda, enter the `saikuda` directory and run `python main.py`. This will install all necessary dependencies and run the application.

To update Saikuda, run `sh update.sh` in the `saikuda` directory.
